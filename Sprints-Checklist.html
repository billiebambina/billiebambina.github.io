            </ul>

            <p>Summary</p>

            <p>Core Skills is about growing the human part of the web development equation. As Bootcamp commences, Core will evolve into the Human Skills curriculum.</p>

            <p>Description</p>

            <p>"To be a good web developer study code. To be a great one, study people." Joshua Vial, Founder of EDA</p>

            <p>Understanding yourself in the context of others and utilizing your Human Skills will set you up for your career. Believe it or not, tech employers aren't looking for top grades or the person with the most outstanding code. Their looking for exceptional human beings who will enhance the culture of their team</p>

            <p>Hiring managers agree that training a person to do the job is relatively easy, but teaching them how to communicate, cooperate and work amongst diverse perspectives is much more complexed task. Thats where Core and Human Skills comes in.</p>

            <p>"Hire for fit, train for skill."</p>

            <p>What will I learn?</p>

            <p>Core will introduce you to techniques to train your mind. You'll learn useful ways of understanding problems and supported to strengthen your self solving skills.</p>

            <p>Core also prepares you for learning experiences drawing from your own agency of values and strengths. It is the culmination of values, awareness and mindset that will maximise both your learning and career journey.</p>

            <p>How will I be assessed?</p>

            <p>Core is assessed through your reflections, such as blog posts and your participation in cohort activities.</p>

                <li>                    Understand the meaning of 'thinking like a developer'
                <li>                    Understand flipped learning
            </ul>

            <p>Summary</p>

            <p>A lot of people think that web development is about writing code. But actually web development is about solving problems and learning to think in a specific kind of way.</p>

            <p>“Everyone in this country should learn to program a computer, because it teaches you to think.” — Steve Jobs</p>

            <p>Thinking like a web developers requires you to develop your problem solving skills. It's a practice that involves understanding the problem, planning your approach and knowing how to get answers.</p>

            <p>Our role is to help you along that path and encourage you to seek what you need to solve the problem. As such, we give you a framework of reference including learning objectives, and mentorship to help you self solve. This type of learning can be uncomfortable at first, especially if you are use to step by step instructions. But this way, you will learn quicker than you ever thought possible. Welcome to the World of Web Development!</p>

            <p>“Almost all employers prioritize problem-solving skills first.</p>

            <p>Problem-solving skills are almost unanimously the most important qualification that employers look for….more than programming languages proficiency, debugging, and system design. Demonstrating computational thinking or the ability to break down large, complex problems is just as valuable (if not more so) than the baseline technical skills required for a job.” — Hacker Rank (2018 Developer Skills Report)</p>

            </ul>

            <p>Summary</p>

            <p>Who you are and what you bring shapes your learning journey. In a flipped classroom context, you are
                responsible for your journey and it's also important to understand what every person is bringing. This exploration requires you to examine and reflect on your identity, and start to articulate what’s at the core of who you are. You will examine your values, ethics, strengths and limitations, what has shaped these, and where you could do some learning that is beneficial to your growth.</p>

            <p>This will form the basis of establishing your Learning Agreement.</p>

        <p>Summary</p>

         <p>This programme is not a traditional programme. It depends a lot on your motivation and organisation as a
            learner. This leads to a more individualised experience and increased learning skills moving forward. To facilitate this everyone will have a Learning Agreement. This learning agreement will be negotiated between you and a facilitator. It will include setting your learning targets based on the course learning outcomes, what you expect to do to meet your targets, and what the facilitator is expected to do. This agreement is a core part of your learning and will develop your skills to set and achieve target in the future. We fully expect this agreement to develop as you become more aware of how you work and learn.</p>

            </ul>

            <p>Summary</p>

            <p>Until recently, the conventional thinking was that our brains were hardwired at birth and therefore
                unchangeable. In actuality, our brains are like malleable plastic that is constantly being reshaped by our daily experiences.</p>

            <p>Science has also revealed that our beliefs about ourselves, what we think and feel about our abilities and our beliefs about 'success' and 'failure' hugely influence our outcomes.</p>

            <p>In this exploration we'll challenge you to think about how neuroplasticity and and a Growth Mindset will boost your capabilities in learning.</p>
