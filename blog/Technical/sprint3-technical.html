    <h3>    What parts of your learning strategy worked? What problems did you face?</h3>


    <p>
    I found it very hard to stay on task when watching Gordon Zhu's videos on Watch and Code.  Although recommended it was very tough to stay awake at times.  So this time instead of avoiding more lessons, and as I am now in the habit of doing so, I looked more into the coding of HTML pages that I have created.  I am currently 60% of the way through, but after talking to a cohort peer I decided to abandon the lessons and instead opt for direct practical applications that is offered with freeCodeCamp.

    [deleted section of whining].... WHY.
    </p>
    <p>
    Otherwise I am enjoying learning the shortcuts of VSC and trying to get a simplier HTML code.
    </p>
    <h3>    Did you learn any new skills or tricks?</h3>


    <p>
    Some java code.  That I have implemented to my Sprints Checklist page.  What some of the names are in the JS convention.  Keyboard shortcuts, I love these.  How to open, start, and end a conversation on Zoom.  That if I add a bit of CSS coding to the UL tag, parent of the li tag, that I can neatly line up the checkboxes aligned to the right of the left aligned list elements.  And I steal code alot from other peoples html and css code. So I have learnt that I am still a magpie apparently.<br>
    Oh and I still throw my notes into a word document so I can visually edit the styles and then bung it into Doc to Html converter.  I really dont want to have to muck around in my HTML trying to make decisions on something I cannot yet see.
    </p>
    <h3>    How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?</h3>


    <p>
    I am never ever confident.  My philosophy is that I am always a learner.
    </p>
    <h3>    Which parts of the work did you enjoy?</h3>


    <p>
    Ranting in my reflects.  For this, I do apologise.
    </p>
    <h3>    Which parts of the work did you find tedious?</h3>


    <p>
    Watching 'Watch and Code'.
    </p>
    <h3>    What did I notice about my learning style, strengths and limitations when researching?</h3>


    <p>
    I enjoy doing practicals and being able to see why would I do a particular function.  Which is why I sort of like looking at someone elses HTML and CSS code and picking and trying code for myself.  I am getting better at typing.  I get super sore shoulders if I type too much. Sometimes yes, I dont know how to ask the right question, however I am very greatful to many resources and forums on the internet (in particular I truely like stack-overflow, finding the answers through others code and being able to get an idea of what code can do is really great).

    <p>I have just finished the DOM tools crashcourse and found that the tools talked about were at once facinating, and hopeless as I have no idea how I would implement it.  Even at double speed it was hard to keep watch.</p>
    </p>
    <h3>    Did any blocks come up for you? How did you overcome them?</h3>


    <p>
    I would fall asleep trying to watch 'Watch and Code'.  So I instead worked on other projects to do with code.  Also learning and revisiting my limitations with my facilitator helped to remind me how to overcome limitations.  Some things are just not yet habit if I forget about them.

    <h2>Discuss</h2>

    <h3>Activity</h3> 
        <p>As if talking to a Non-technical friend, discuss:</p>
    
        <ul>
            <li>An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS
            <li>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.
            <li>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.
            <li>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.
            <li>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.
        </ul>
        
        <p>I like to think of HTML like the basic bones of a project.  For example if you want to you could think of html like it is a bicycle.  You can make a bike be very simple - the frame, two wheels, a basic paint job, a system for brakes and for changing gears, and basic handlebars.  Lets say this bike is your one for all terrains type bike.  So decent wide tyres to grip everything.  And thats it.  This bike is very basic and will get you from A to B.</p>
        <p>Then you can use CSS, which is the way of styling your bike/html.  With CSS, you can modify everything to look very, very fancy.  You can add lights for safety, reflectors, modify the frame and the tyres for lightness and speed or durability and extra grip.</p>

        <p>I would explain what control flow and loops were but I may have died at the point that it came up.</p>

        <p>The DOM, document/object/model, is a very fun tool you can use to mess with a website locally to your computer, or help you to modify and fix something with a webpage you are making.  Recently I *struggled* through a DOM youtube crashcourse.  The way to access it is through the webpage you are currently on, rightclicking and selecting inspect.  Or however else you can access a inspector.<br>
        Using it you can see which tag in your HTML script is causing a problem, for example: a margin or box that is forcing itself too far to the left, or something that you really dont like on the page.  Using the inspector you can find out which line is causing the issue, and then change the code to fix the problem.  And it is cool because you can deactivate element attribues or, modify them to see what will happen to the webpage - Live!!!</p>

        <p>I cant really explain the difference between arrays and objects because I really was dead when it was being explained... or not.</p>

        <p>Functions may to be able to take many very simple steps that belong together and group them as a function. I am not sure, great question.</p>
