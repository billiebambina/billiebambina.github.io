          <h2 class="box">The difference between ID and Class, and best practices.</h2>

          <h3 class="box1 box2">written by billie, all info abridged.  Use at your own learning peril</h3>

          <p>Classes and IDs are used in CSS scripts, implemented on HTML pages.</p>

          <p>Classes are created using a full stop "." before its selector, ie .funkyheader {colour: red;} <br>IDs are created using a hash "#" before its selector, ie #prettybg {background-colour: blue;} <br>(btw HTML has its own basic styling scripts).</p>

          <p>You will see these being made either in a separate style sheet - that will be linked to the HTML document header; or being created 'inline' in its own section in the HTML document header.</p>

          <p>Classes are attributes used on tags. ie. 'h2 class="funkyheader">Hello World/h2>'.
              IDs are attributes used on tags. ie. 'body id="prettybg">' ...[allyourcodearebelonghere]... '/body>'</p>

          <h3 class="box1">The difference between ID and Class:</h3>

          <p>ID should and is only to be used to identify one element.  Not lots. <br> One reason is because you want to keep certain elements UNIQUE. Like for SEO, so that your browser can locate the element on page.  ie. you have an element called comments, and thats all you want your search engine to take you to. (though if the designer was smart you'd just be using the navigation on the page, right?).  Anyway, there are things on your HTML you want to keep solid like a rock.</p>

          <h3 class="box3">Classes can select many elements.</h3>

          <p>And they are great at making many specific stylings and giving control over lots of small things.  From boxes with margins around texts to containers around whole texts and images with its own unique coloured BG to telling the HTML to make all the paragraphs in colour:red; NO! colour:coral; font-name: Helvetica; NOOO! font-name: ArialNarrow; with margins of 5 and everything blinks...</p>

          <p>So I guess you can think of IDs like an eternal christmas tree, and Classes are the ever changing tinsel and baubles that go on it.</p>
