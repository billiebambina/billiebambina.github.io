    <h1>Classes Vs. IDs</h1>
    <h2>What are the best practices associated with their use?</h2>
    <h3>Wednesday 7th November 2018</h3>
    
    <p>First of all - what is a class, and an id, in relation to HTML?
     <br>
     When you set up the basic bones of a HTML page, such as your header 1-6 tags, paragraph tags, list type tags, body tags etc, you will have a running web page that is very, bare bones.</p>
    <p>In order to jazz it up and go beyond the limitations of HTML stylings, ID and Class tags were created.  These allow for further styling of selected and groups of tags to be finely manipulated within the style header section or on a separate style sheet; as opposed to loading a tag with inline styling - which can look messy.</p>
