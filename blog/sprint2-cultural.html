                A learning agreement is a honest but imperfect document to help the learner and the facilitator follow a guideline suited to the learners needs, hopes for improvement, expectations, disciplinary methods and disaster planning.

                Not great at juggling tasks - prefers one after the other

                Too dependant on others opinions

                Based on the above “strengths and weaknesses” lists I have a better idea of how I will manage myself personally, and based off of what should be a universal student learning agreement basic I will endeavour to:
                Actively participate in the lesson and be fully engaged at all times;
                Actively seek feedback on how to improve the quality of my work;
                Be resilience and persevere with all challenges, even when they are difficult; Try to sort out problems myself but also seek guidance from peers and facilitators;
                Manage own time and be self-disciplined;
                Uses initiative and don’t always need to be told what to do;
                Goes above and beyond what the facilitator asks of them.
                
                Personally I will endeavour to improve on what I know are my weaknesses, especially if I want to be successful not only in the Foundations/Bootcamp program, but also in the professional/working environment.
                
                - Self-awareness - realise when Im struggling early on.  Stay aware of how much time is left to complete by deadline.  Estimate how much time you need to complete a exercise.  If struggling follow methods of problem solving/identify what exactly it is you are struggling with.  If you need more time talk to Kelly ASAP. dont wait.
                
                - Planning/Organising -  Use your planner to note due dates and commitments.  Keep mindful of what commitments require.
                
                - Timeliness - instead of snoozing your early alarm - on the first ring open up netflix and watch a cartoon.  This will wake you up slowly but effectively.
                Get a bicycle when you get enough money.
                
                - Learn how to Negotiate.  Learn why you have low ambition or an avoidance of challenges.  Ask what makes someone good at self-management.  Know how to best deal with someone who is draining your assertiveness.  Ask around of industry vets how to manage mental health when it starts to impede and how to plan for bad days - like - best management practice.
                
                - If unsure about taking the initiative ask questions - clarify a little, and then leap in.  I should be able to learn on the fly.
                
                
                
                I will try to recognise early on when I may need to ask for help, though I will appreciate it if the facilitator can see me struggling, to please let me know or to ask me if I need any help.
                
                From the facilitators, I would appreciate from them:
                To have an idea of where I should be (if obviously I am not D: )/ assignments I should be working on at any time.
                To push me when needed
                Not allow themselves to be bogged down with a slack student
                Know enough about individuals and their contribution to team dynamics to make it effective
                No allow distractions
                Motivate us.  Help us to envision the bigger picture so we are not lost in the current minutiae of what we are learning.
                Clear instructions that don't jump from one place to another out of context
                Point out the obvious when needed
                Call out things may not be right
                Don't let us stumble on through in our ignorance :(
                
                Using this very raw, first attempt at writing my own Learning Agreement I will endeavour to do my best and if changes are needed then be flexible enough to make changes as needed.
