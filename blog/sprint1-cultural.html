                Here are four ways to help you build on this strength
                1 Make sure you're thinking logically and objectively
                Explore many different approaches to a situation to make sure you're thinking logically and objectively.
                2 Base your opinions on evidence
                Before you make a generalisation, make sure you have the evidence to back it up.
                3 Question your assumptions
                The same applies to assumptions. Always question what you assume to be true.
                4 Make connections
                Map out your thought process on paper. This will help you make connections and aid your thinking.
