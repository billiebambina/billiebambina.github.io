            <h1>Billies Learning Agreement</h1>
            <h3>November 2018</h3>
            <h3>Version 1.1</h3>
            <p>
            A learning agreement is a honest but imperfect document to help the learner and
            the facilitator follow a guideline suited to the learners needs, hopes for
            improvement, expectations, disciplinary methods and disaster planning.

            Based on the above "strengths and weaknesses" lists I have a better idea of how
            I will manage myself personally, and based off of what may be a universal
            student learning agreement basic I will endeavour to:
            </p><ul>
            <li>Actively participate in the lesson and be fully engaged at all times;
            <li>Actively seek feedback on how to improve the quality of my work;
            <li>Be resilience and persevere with all challenges, even when they are
            difficult; Try to sort out problems myself but also seek guidance from peers and
            facilitators;
            <li>Manage own time and be self-disciplined;
            <li>Uses initiative and don't always need to be told what to do;
            <li>Goes above and beyond what the facilitator asks of them.</li></ul>
            <p>
            <hr>
            </p>
            <p>
            Personally I will endeavour to improve on what I know are my weaknesses,
            especially if I want to be successful not only in the Foundations/Bootcamp
            program, but also in the professional/working environment.
            </p>
            <p>
            - Self-awareness - realise when I'm struggling early on.  Stay aware of how much
            time is left to complete by deadline.  Estimate how much time you need to
            complete a exercise.  If struggling follow methods of problem solving/identify
            what exactly it is you are struggling with.  If you need more time talk to Kelly
            ASAP. Don't wait.
            </p>
            <p>
            - Planning/Organising -  Use your planner to note due dates and commitments.
            Keep mindful of what commitments require.
            </p>
            <p>
            - Timeliness - instead of snoozing your early alarm - on the first ring open up
            netflix and watch a cartoon.  This will wake you up slowly but effectively.<br>
            Get a bicycle when you get enough money.
            </p>
            <p>
            - Learn how to Negotiate.  Learn why you have low ambition or an avoidance of
            challenges.  Ask what makes someone good at self-management.  Know how to best
            deal with someone who is draining your assertiveness.  Ask around of industry
            vets how to manage mental health when it starts to impede and how to plan for
            bad days - like - best management practice.
            </p>
            <p>
            - If unsure about taking the initiative ask questions - clarify a little, and
            then leap in.  I should be able to learn on the fly.
            </p>
            <p>
            </p>
            <p>
            - Communication and Check-in.  Keep up a weekly dialogue with your facilitator
            through slack (or onsite) to ensure that yourself and your facilitator know
            where you are up to at anytime.  Message Kelly every Friday on Slack after
            checking checklist.
            </p>
            <p>
            - Lists - create a checklist of things I need to do throughout Foundations and
            Bootcamp to have something to checkoff in order to ensure consistency and
            completion.  Lists are an essential tool to aid in the case of inattention and
            forgetfulness.
            </p>
            <p>
            <hr>
            </p>
            <p>
            I will try to recognise early on when I may need to ask for help, though I will
            appreciate it if the facilitator can see me struggling, to please let me know or
            to ask me if I need any help.
            </p>
            <p>
            From the facilitators, I would appreciate from them:
            </p><ul>
            <li>To have an idea of where I should be (if obviously I am not D: )/
            assignments I should be working on at any time.
            <li>To push me when needed
            <li>Not allow themselves to be bogged down with a slack student?
            <li>Know enough about individuals and their contribution to team dynamics to
            make it effective
            <li>Not allow distractions
            <li>Motivate us.  Help us to envision the bigger picture so we are not lost in
            the current minutiae of what we are learning.
            <li>Clear instructions that don't jump from one place to another out of context
            <li>Point out the obvious when needed
            <li>Call out things that may not be right
            <li>Don't let us stumble on through in our ignorance :(
            <li>Allow us to unwind as necessary - ie. exercise or rest if
            stressed/struggling</li></ul>
            <p>
            Using this very raw, first attempt at writing my own Learning Agreement I will
            endeavour to do my best and if changes are needed then be flexible enough to
            make changes as needed.
