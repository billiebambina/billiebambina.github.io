                        2 Base your opinions on evidence<br>

                        3 Question your assumptions<br>
                        The same applies to assumptions. Always question what you assume to be true.<br>
                        4 Make connections<br>
                        Map out your thought process on paper. This will help you make connections and aid your thinking.</p>
