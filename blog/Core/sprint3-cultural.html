    <h1>Reflection.</h1>
    <h2>    What it was like for you to practice mindfulness?</h2>
    <p>
    It was and still is, a great way for me to really learn and understand myself, as well as others.
    </p>
    <h2>    Have you done mindfulness or attention training before?</h2>
    <p>
    Yes.  I have been on a mindful journey since I moved to wellington in 2013/with every therapist I see.
    </p>
    <h2>    Are you able to identify any bias you have for or against mindfulness?</h2>
    <p>
    I guess my bias is that mindfulness is necessary to being a better person.
    </p>
    <h2>    What did you notice as you were meditating?</h2>
    <p>
    That I am uncomfortable and I hate when my ribs are touched.
    </p>
    <p>
    After meditating I have noticed that I am much calmer and my thoughts are less overwhelming/I can sleep much quicker than without.
    </p>
    <h2>    How did you find the overall experience?</h2>
    <p>
    An improvement every time I do it.
    </p>
    <h2>    What's your daily habit commitment?</h2>
    <p>
    As of joining the Dev-Acad Foundations I have been able to make as a habit - daily learning with hands on coding.
    </p>
    <p>
    I will continue to be mindful about making daily improvements and, being aware that I am growing.
    </p>
    <h2>    What was it like to be fully listened to?</h2>
    <p>
    In regards to this sprints particular exercise only: It is good.
    </p>
    <h2>    What was it like to fully listen?</h2>
    <p>
    Relaxing.  To allow someone to fully express without my interruptions and to instead be present while they are talking is a good practice.
    </p>
    <h2>    What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
    <p>
    EI or EQ (emotional quotient) is apparently the ability to read a person and (one would hope) read a room.  This allows a person to behave in a complex yet seemingly simple way when interacting with anything. Be it Human, cute bunny, or a ball with a face drawn on it.
    </p>
    <h2>    How is it different to IQ?</h2>
    <p>
    IQ (intelligence quotient) is only how well a person does on a particular quiz.  Unfortunately the term doesn't even encompass the wide range of intelligences out there - such as being illiterate but at the same time an amazing business person, a savant who couldn't read any of this opinion piece but inspires movies about code breaking government secrets.
    </p>
    <p>
    But in general IQ is just a way to say that you are very smart.
    </p>
    <h2>    Why is it important?</h2>
    <p>
    It is important to be able to balanced in terms of your emotions and intelligence rationale.
    </p>
    <p>
    If you were to be 'over-emotional' you may be more inclined to be biased towards the feelings of others and yourself instead of the progression and functioning of a common objective.
    </p>
    <p>
    The reverse would be to be so rational that the objectives are to be met regardless of how it may hurt the others that are trying to achieve the same objective. (I fatally think of Capitalism...)
    </p>
    <p>
    So in my understanding of EQ, it is a way to function as someone who is knowledgeable in a particular field, but also possesses a character that is agreeable/personable when dealing with peers, clients and in general.
    </p>
    <p>
    Though, when talking about 'Emotions' per se, there are two ways that emotion is responded to: Sympathetic, and Empathetic.
    </p>
    <p>
    Both have their pros and cons and to be thoroughly biased I hate sympathetic people.  Sympathetic people may be able to see that someone is having a hard time but they'd be the type to sit there on the sideline making comments about how glad they aren't that person.  AN EMPATHETIC PERSON WILL GO OVER TO THAT PERSON AND SEE HOW THEY CAN HELP.  Accessibility is definitely the domain of the empathetic problem solver.

    </p>
    <p>
    EQ vs. IQ. Emotional Intelligence, or emotional quotient (EQ), is defined as an individual's ability to identify, evaluate, control, and express emotions. ... IQ, or intelligence quotient, is score derived from one of several standardized tests designed to assess an individual's intelligence.
